# BOMAAB - APPs are Boarding

This guide will describe a setup for self-hosted, always-updated download/IAP statistics visualized by [Panic's Status Board](http://www.panic.com/statusboard/).

## Requirements:
- server with Java, MySQL, Bash, PHP, Cron
- Apple developer account
- StatusBoard APP

## tl;dr

- copy <tt>update.sh</tt>, <tt>index.php</tt>, <tt>login.properties</tt> and <tt>db.php</tt> to a folder of your web server
- download and decompress [Autoingestion](http://apple.com/itunesnews/docs/Autoingestion.class.zip) to that folder
- create the MySQL table described under "MySQL setup"
- open <tt>login.properties</tt> and enter your credentials
- open <tt>update.sh</tt> and enter your vendor ID in the header
- enter them again in <tt>db.php</tt>  (note: if you don't wish to use your normal iTunes Connect user/password, you can create a "sales-only" sub-user with a different password)
- run update.sh manually and check if everything runs fine; create a crontab entry for regular updates
- open Status Board on your iPad, create a new "Graph", enter the URL to your webserver's folder

Enjoy your downloads!

# Setup

MacMini with OS-X Server and DynDNS is running fine for me even on a DSL connection but YMMV. For BOMAAB OS-X Server can easily be replaced by [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/), upgrading to PRO gives you a nice graphical installer and control app. Although I have installed [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) from the original package I prefer [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com) for data retrieval and management a lot - this tool is amazing! Apart from the Terminal I use [TextMate](http://macromates.com) for editing and [Cronnix](http://code.google.com/p/cronnix/) to edit my crontab - yes, I confess, I'm a visual coder, not a Terminal hacker.

# 1. Step: Importing reports into a local database

In the [APP Store Reporting Instructions](http://www.apple.com/itunesnews/docs/AppStoreReportingInstructions.pdf) Apple provides the link to the Autoingestion class. This Java class will be used to download the daily reports, which are initially stored as a CSV file and imported later into a MySQL database.

Create a folder anywhere you like for downloading the reports regularly, copy <tt>login.properties</tt> into this folder and open it to adjust your login credentials:

	userID = "your-apple-id"
	password = "your-password"

This is your Apple-ID and password for [itunesconnect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com).

If you don't wish to use your normal iTunes Connect user/password, you can create a "sales-only" sub-user with a different password.

Copy and open <tt>update.sh</tt> and enter your vendor ID. 

	APPLEVENDORID="your-vendor-id"

This number can be found in [itunesconnect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com) under "Sales and Trends". In the headline, after your login name, the number like <tt>80012345</tt> is your Vendor ID.

	MYSQLUSER="your-mysql-username"
	MYSQLPASSWORD="your-mysql-password"

This is your user name and password for the MySQL database. The downloaded daily reports will partially be stored into your MySQL table.

	LOGDIR="$HOME/Library/Logs"

Set this to where you want the log file placed. The default is fine for OS X; Linux/\*BSD users may want to set this to `/var/log` or something else.

	OSXDATE="YES"

Set this to YES if your `date` command supports the `-v` flag to calculate and print dates in the past (run `man date` to find out if yours does or not.  Most Linux/`*BSD variants don't.)

	REQUIRES_LOCAL_INFILE="NO"

Set this to "YES" if your `mysqld` requires the `--local-infile=1` flag.  If you run the script but get the error `The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version` then yours does.  Note that if this is the case, you will also need to modify the `mysqld` configuration file.  Edit the file `/etc/my.cnf` and in the `[mysqld]` section, ensure that the line `local-infile=1` is present.  (if it isn't, or the value is set to something other than `1`, add/change it appropriately.)

## MySQL setup

The scripts assumes a database called <tt>itunesconnect</tt> with a table called <tt>sales</tt>. Its structure is closely modeled after the reports file format. Create the table with the following SQL command:

	CREATE TABLE `sales` (
	  `Provider` varchar(255),
	  `ProviderCountry` varchar(255),
	  `SKU` varchar(255),
	  `Developer` varchar(255),
	  `Title` varchar(255),
	  `Version` varchar(255),
	  `ProductTypeIdentifier` varchar(255),
	  `Units` int(11) NOT NULL,
	  `DeveloperProceeds` float NOT NULL,
	  `BeginDate` date NOT NULL,
	  `EndDate` date NOT NULL,
	  `CustomerCurrency` varchar(255),
	  `CountryCode` varchar(255),
	  `CurrencyOfProceeds` varchar(255),
	  `AppleIdentifier` varchar(255),
	  `CustomerPrice` float NOT NULL,
	  `PromoCode` varchar(255),
	  `ParentIdentifier` varchar(255),
	  `Subscription` varchar(255),
	  `Period` varchar(255)
	) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

## Synopsis: update.sh [YYYYMMDD]

The <tt>update.sh</tt> script accepts one optional parameter: the date for which to download and import the report in the format YYYYMMDD. If no parameter was given the script will load the daily report for **yesterday**!

*Caution:*
You cannot load a daily report for the current day, in fact you even have to wait half a day or longer (at least in Europe I'll have to wait until 18:00 to get the report for yesterday).

If the download succeeds, it will decompress the downloaded file, import its content into the database and finally remove the file.

## Test your setup

Run <tt>update.sh</tt> and you should see the message from the Autoingestion class (hopefully something like "File Downloaded Successfully"). You should now test wether the <tt>sales</tt> table contains the entries from this import, looking for entries with the same BeginDate date like the script date (assuming that you had downloads for your APP at this date).

*Hint:*
For debugging purposes the script logs error or success messages to a logfile under <tt>~/Library/Logs/update.log</tt> - open the Console app and you should see the entries there.

## Import old reports

Running <tt>update.sh</tt> with older dates will import those reports from Apple.

*Caution:*
You can only go back as much as 30 days but not longer!

## Regular report updates

On unix, you can add a crontab entry to call this <tt>update.sh</tt> script regularly. Open *Cronnix* and create a new entry, specifying the complete path to this script and a time when this script should be called.

Example for a script, running at 18:00 every day:

	0	18	*	*	*	/FOLDER-OF-SCRIPT/update.sh

# 2. Step: Generate a Status Board compatible report

Once importing the data went fine, you can generate graphs for Status Board with the <tt>index.php</tt> script: create a folder within reach of your web server, copy <tt>index.php</tt> and <tt>db.php</tt> there, open the <tt>db.php</tt> script and adjust your MySQL login credentials (this DB class is an old wrapper of mine aging years ago, it can easily be replaced by any other DB wrapper).

The <tt>index.php</tt> script currently looks for download numbers or In-App-Purchases only, generates those numbers for the last 30 days and groups them accordingly. It then outputs those numbers in the JSON format described in the [manual](http://www.panic.com/statusboard/docs/graph_tutorial.pdf).

## Generate graphs

Open Status Board, switch to the setup mode with the gear icon in the upper left corner, then add a Graph to your panel and enter the URL from your server into the Data URL field.

IAP graph example:

	http://your-server.com/path-to-folder/index.php?iap

Download graph example:

	http://your-server.com/path-to-folder/index.php?dl

Because download numbers are default, you can shorten the link like this:

	http://your-server.com/path-to-folder/

# Notes

- you can add htaccess/htpasswd or any other security measures to your graph script folder
- again for improved security you can seperate the <tt>update.sh</tt> script folder from your graph script folder
- apart from my university days long ago this is my first bash script - it's fairly tested but a unix geek could improve it, I bet
- direct purchase numbers are not handled - yet
- you can copy and modify the <tt>update.sh</tt> script to import even older daily reports you might have in a backup

# Version

- nov, 2013: updated credential mechanism to honour the login.properties file mechanism for the latest Apple Autoingestion.class
